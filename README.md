# nand_assembler
Day 3 on teaching myself Rust from docs only ( learning how to read docs better ) I decided to branch out from the doc projects and write a rrly bad assembler for nand2tetris. Rather than save to file it just outputs it in console atm. Might add file functionality if I feel like it later.
